Python Web Client Readme
==========================

The Python Web Client (PWC, mostly), is a web service to allow you to 
interrogate other web services by sending requests to them. This is intended to
assist in debugging and documenting the interfaces of these other services.

To use it, first make sure it is registered with your Python:

> python setup.py develop

Then start it (will open a browser):

> python start_pwc.py
