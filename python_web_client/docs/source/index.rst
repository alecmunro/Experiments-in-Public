   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Python Web Client's documentation!
=============================================

The Python Web Client (occasionally PWC), is a Python implementation of 
`hurl <https://github.com/defunkt/hurl>`_. It was created by Alec Munro for his 
`portfolio blog <http://alecmunro.blogspot.com/>`_, though the idea was originally
suggested by the `SoCal Piggies <https://bitbucket.org/socal.piggies/pwc/wiki/Home>`_ 
(and their site has many more details about the idea).

It provides a web interface to allow the creation of a request to URL, and 
displays the response to that request. It is currently very underfeatured 
compared to `hurl <https://github.com/defunkt/hurl>`_.
