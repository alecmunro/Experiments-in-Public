Experiments with different python mock object libraries.

The application to be tested is a caching service. 
It periodically connects to a another machine, through a client, downloads the 
data to be cached, and writes it to a file.

So, how will we divide that functionality up? Maybe one main loop, that calls 
methods to sync the cache, and then write it?
